### **Introduction**

This repository contains a neural network model developed using Keras for binary classification of heart disease. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of various patient attributes, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and demographics.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for training and evaluation is provided in directory. It includes the following columns:

* **HeartDiseaseorAttack:** Target variable indicating whether a person has experienced a heart disease or attack (0 or 1).
* **HighBP:** Indicates whether the person has high blood pressure.
* **HighChol:** Indicates whether the person has high cholesterol.
* **CholCheck:** Indicates whether the person has had a cholesterol check.
* **BMI:** Body Mass Index.
* **Smoker:** Indicates whether the person is a smoker.
* **Stroke:** Indicates whether the person has had a stroke.
* **Diabetes:** Indicates whether the person has diabetes.
* **PhysActivity:** Indicates whether the person is physically active.
* **Fruits:** Indicates how often the person eats fruits.
* **Veggies:** Indicates how often the person eats vegetables.
* **HvyAlcoholConsump:** Indicates whether the person consumes heavy alcohol.
* **AnyHealthcare:** Indicates whether the person has any healthcare coverage.
* **NoDocbcCost:** Indicates whether the person has no doctor because of cost.
* **GenHlth:** General health rating.
* **MentHlth:** Mental health rating.
* **PhysHlth:** Physical health rating.
* **DiffWalk:** Indicates whether the person has difficulty walking.
* **Sex:** Gender.
* **Age:** Age.
* **Education:** Education level.
* **Income:** Income level.

### **Model Architecture**

The neural network model is a [specify the architecture, e.g., sequential model with hidden layers, dropout, activation functions, etc.]. The model is trained using [specify optimization algorithm, loss function, and metrics].

### **Usage**

1. **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.
2. **Prepare data:** Load the dataset and preprocess it as needed (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).
3. **Train the model:** Run the training script to train the model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluate performance:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
